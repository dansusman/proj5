# Web Crawler, Project 5

This is the source code for Project 5 of CS3700 Networks and Distributed Systems, authored by Dean Frame and Dan Susman Fall 2021.

## High-level Approach

- started with postman
- figured out cookies, tokens, and general HTTP formatting (using slides from class)
- implemented logic using two sets (pages to visit and pages seen)
- started with deque implementation, optimized with a set

## Challenges Faced

- server down, hard to test code
- performance considerations
- figuring out login/302 stuff

## Testing the Code

- ran on Khoury VMs
- ran on PCs
- printing requests and responses
